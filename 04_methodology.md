   - Conduct controlled simulations with 200 participants to evaluate system performance, usability, and scalability under various scenarios.

### 4.1.3 Phase 3: Data Integration and Model Development

This critical phase involves synthesizing qualitative and quantitative findings to develop a robust evaluative framework.

1. **Data Triangulation**:

   - Integrate data from interviews, focus groups, surveys, and simulations to identify convergent and divergent themes.
   - Validate findings through member checking and peer debriefing.

2. **Development of an Evaluative Model**:

   - Construct a multidimensional model assessing technical feasibility, social acceptability, legal compatibility, and economic viability.
   - Apply predictive analytics to forecast potential outcomes of system implementation.

# 3. Literature Review

## 3.1 Introduction

The integrity of electoral processes is fundamental to the legitimacy of democratic governance. Recent advancements in blockchain technology have sparked significant interest in its potential application to voting systems, aiming to enhance transparency, security, and public trust. This chapter provides a critical analysis of existing literature on blockchain-based voting systems, examining their technological underpinnings, implementation experiences in various countries, and the specific challenges and opportunities they present for Bangladesh's parliamentary elections. The review identifies key gaps in current research and sets the stage for proposing a tailored blockchain-based voting solution for Bangladesh.

## 3.2 Blockchain-Based Voting Systems

### 3.2.1 Technological Foundations

Blockchain technology, introduced by Nakamoto (2008) through Bitcoin, operates as a decentralized ledger that records transactions across multiple nodes in a network. Its core features—decentralization, immutability, transparency, and cryptographic security—make it a compelling candidate for secure voting systems (Yavuz et al., 2018; Kshetri & Voas, 2018).

- **Decentralization**: Eliminates the need for a central authority, distributing control across the network and reducing the risk of single points of failure or centralized manipulation (Hughes et al., 2019).
- **Immutability**: Ensures that once a vote is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, safeguarding the integrity of electoral records (Zheng et al., 2018).
- **Transparency**: Provides all participants with access to the ledger, enabling real-time auditing and increasing accountability (Noizat, 2015).
- **Cryptographic Security**: Employs advanced encryption methods to protect voter anonymity and prevent unauthorized access (Dagher et al., 2018).

These characteristics address critical vulnerabilities in traditional voting systems, such as fraud, tampering, and lack of transparency, which are particularly prevalent in contexts with contested electoral integrity (Rahman, 2019).

### 3.2.2 Architectures and Protocols

The architecture of a blockchain-based voting system significantly influences its performance, security, and scalability (Schwartz et al., 2016). Key architectures include:

- **Public Blockchains**: Open networks like Ethereum offer high transparency but face scalability and privacy challenges, making them less suitable for national elections (Buterin, 2014; Park et al., 2021).
- **Permissioned Blockchains**: Networks such as Hyperledger Fabric restrict access to known entities, enhancing privacy and control while maintaining some level of decentralization (Androulaki et al., 2018).
- **Consortium Blockchains**: A hybrid approach where the network is controlled by a group of organizations, balancing transparency and efficiency (Sousa et al., 2018).

Consensus mechanisms are vital for blockchain security and efficiency:

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Secure but energy-intensive, making it impractical for large-scale elections (Nakamoto, 2008).
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: More energy-efficient but can be vulnerable to security risks if not properly implemented (King & Nadal, 2012).
- **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**: Offers high throughput and low latency, suitable for permissioned networks (Castro & Liskov, 1999).

The selection of architecture and consensus protocols must consider the specific needs and constraints of the electoral context.

### 3.2.3 Smart Contracts in Voting Systems

Smart contracts are self-executing agreements encoded on the blockchain, which can automate and secure electoral processes (Zheng et al., 2020):

- **Voter Registration**: Automates eligibility verification, reducing errors and administrative burden (McCorry et al., 2017).
- **Vote Casting and Counting**: Ensures accurate recording and instantaneous tallying of votes, minimizing human error (Hardwick et al., 2018).
- **Audit Trails**: Creates immutable records of all transactions, enhancing transparency and facilitating post-election audits (Zhang et al., 2020).

Proper coding and auditing of smart contracts are essential to prevent vulnerabilities that could compromise the system (Tikhomirov et al., 2018).

## 3.3 Case Studies from Other Countries

### 3.3.1 Estonia's Internet Voting System

Estonia is a pioneer in implementing nationwide electronic voting:

- **Implementation**: Introduced internet voting (i-Voting) in 2005, with continuous enhancements to security and infrastructure (Heiberg et al., 2018).
- **Technology**: Utilizes end-to-end encryption, secure digital IDs for voter authentication, and a public codebase for transparency (Vinkel, 2020).
- **Outcomes**: High adoption rates, with 46.7% of votes cast online in the 2019 parliamentary elections, demonstrating increased voter convenience and accessibility (Estonian National Electoral Committee, 2019).
- **Challenges**: Ongoing concerns about cybersecurity threats and the need to ensure voter anonymity and data protection (Springall et al., 2014).

Estonia's experience underscores the importance of robust security measures, legal frameworks, and public trust in adopting electronic voting solutions.

### 3.3.2 West Virginia's Mobile Voting Pilot

West Virginia conducted a mobile voting pilot using blockchain technology:

- **Implementation**: Deployed during the 2018 midterm elections for military personnel stationed overseas (Warner, 2018).
- **Technology**: Utilized the Voatz app, incorporating biometric authentication and a permissioned blockchain for secure vote recording (Voatz, 2020).
- **Outcomes**: Improved accessibility for absentee voters with 144 participants across 24 countries, though on a limited scale (Warner, 2018).
- **Challenges**: Criticized for potential security vulnerabilities, lack of transparency, and reliance on proprietary software (Specter et al., 2020).

The pilot highlights the complexities of balancing usability, security, and transparency in blockchain-based voting applications.

### 3.3.3 Sierra Leone's Blockchain Initiative

Sierra Leone explored blockchain technology in its electoral process:

- **Implementation**: Partnered with Agora to record votes on a blockchain during the 2018 presidential elections (Agora, 2018).
- **Technology**: Employed a permissioned blockchain to create a parallel system for vote tallying and verification (Agora, 2018).
- **Outcomes**: Demonstrated potential for enhancing transparency but was not officially adopted for result determination (Orcutt, 2018).
- **Challenges**: Miscommunication about the extent of blockchain use and questions about scalability and official integration (Orcutt, 2018).

This case emphasizes the need for clear communication, stakeholder engagement, and addressing scalability concerns in blockchain voting initiatives.

## 3.4 Security and Privacy Considerations

### 3.4.1 Cryptographic Techniques

Protecting voter privacy and ensuring data security are paramount:

- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows computations on encrypted data, enabling vote tallying without decrypting individual votes (Araujo et al., 2016).
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enable verification of voter eligibility and vote integrity without revealing sensitive information (Ben-Sasson et al., 2014).
- **Ring Signatures**: Provide anonymity by allowing a signer to act on behalf of a group without disclosing their identity (Noether, 2015).

These techniques enhance security but may introduce computational overhead, affecting system performance (Castelló Ferrer et al., 2021).

### 3.4.2 Voter Authentication Mechanisms

Secure and accessible authentication is critical:

- **Biometric Authentication**: Uses unique physiological characteristics but raises privacy concerns and requires robust data protection measures (Ashok et al., 2020).
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Combines passwords, tokens, and biometrics to enhance security (Pillitteri & Brewer, 2019).
- **Blockchain-Based Identity Management**: Employs decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to give users control over their digital identities (Preukschat & Reed, 2021).

In regions with varying levels of technological infrastructure, ensuring widespread accessibility while maintaining security is a significant challenge (Rahman & Yeasmin, 2020).

### 3.4.3 Resistance to Manipulation and Attacks

Blockchain systems must be resilient against various threats:

- **51% Attacks**: In permissioned blockchains, controlling node access mitigates the risk of a majority attack (Wang et al., 2019).
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Require thorough testing and formal verification to prevent exploitation (Atzei et al., 2017).
- **Denial-of-Service Attacks**: Distributed networks offer inherent resistance, but additional safeguards are necessary (Kshetri & Voas, 2018).

Continuous monitoring and updating of security protocols are essential to protect against evolving threats (Zheng et al., 2018).

## 3.5 Gaps in Existing Research

### 3.5.1 Scalability and Performance Challenges

Current studies often focus on small-scale implementations, with limited exploration of scalability for populous nations:

- **Transaction Throughput**: High voter volumes, as seen in Bangladesh, require systems capable of handling millions of transactions efficiently (Zamani et al., 2018).
- **Network Latency**: Poor internet connectivity in rural areas can impede system performance (Islam et al., 2021).
- **Resource Requirements**: Computational and storage demands may exceed the capacities of existing infrastructure (Kim & Lee, 2021).

Addressing these challenges is crucial for practical large-scale deployment.

### 3.5.2 Integration with Existing Electoral Infrastructure

Research on melding blockchain solutions with traditional systems is scarce:

- **Hybrid Models**: Combining blockchain with established voting methods could offer transitional solutions (Augusto et al., 2019).
- **Interoperability**: Ensuring seamless operation with current technologies and processes is necessary for acceptance (Kouhizadeh et al., 2019).
- **Legal Compatibility**: Adapting electoral laws to accommodate technological changes requires comprehensive analysis (Esayas, 2018).

Developing frameworks for integration can facilitate smoother adoption and mitigate resistance.

### 3.5.3 Socio-Technical Considerations

The human element in technological adoption is underrepresented:

- **Digital Literacy**: Varying levels of technological understanding can affect usability and trust (Rahman & Yeasmin, 2020).
- **Public Perception**: Skepticism toward new technologies may hinder acceptance without adequate education and transparency (Mendiluce & van Dijk, 2021).
- **Accessibility**: Systems must be designed to accommodate users with disabilities and ensure inclusivity (Velleman et al., 2017).

Greater focus on socio-technical research can enhance system design and acceptance.

## 3.6 Relevance to Bangladesh's Electoral Context

### 3.6.1 Addressing Voter List Inaccuracies

Blockchain can improve the accuracy and integrity of voter registries:

- **Immutable Records**: Prevent unauthorized alterations, ensuring only eligible voters can participate (Hassan & Nazneen, 2017).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Facilitate timely inclusion of new eligible voters and removal of outdated entries (McCorry et al., 2017).
- **Distributed Verification**: Enables multiple stakeholders to verify voter information, enhancing transparency (Yavuz et al., 2018).

Implementing these features can reduce fraud and build public confidence in the electoral process.

### 3.6.2 Enhancing Transparency and Trust

Transparency is crucial in a context of eroded public trust:

- **Auditability**: Transparent recording of votes allows for verification by independent observers (Atzori, 2017).
- **Decentralized Oversight**: Reduces the potential for manipulation by any single entity (Riaz, 2019).
- **Public Engagement**: Increased transparency can foster greater public participation and confidence (Noizat, 2015).

Blockchain's inherent features align with the need for increased accountability in Bangladesh's elections.

### 3.6.3 Overcoming Infrastructure Limitations

Adapting to infrastructural challenges is essential:

- **Off-Chain Solutions**: Leveraging technologies like SMS voting or offline data collection with later blockchain integration (Islam et al., 2021).
- **Phased Implementation**: Starting with urban areas or pilot projects to test and refine the system (Solvak & Vassil, 2018).
- **Capacity Building**: Training personnel and educating the public to build technological competency (Kabir & Zhenhui, 2020).

Tailoring the implementation strategy to Bangladesh's context can enhance feasibility.

## 3.7 Summary

The literature indicates that while blockchain technology holds significant promise for enhancing electoral integrity, particularly in areas of transparency and security, substantial challenges remain. These include technical scalability, legal and regulatory adaptations, and socio-cultural acceptance. The particular circumstances of Bangladesh—such as infrastructural limitations, digital literacy levels, and historical electoral challenges—necessitate a carefully designed approach. This study aims to contribute to this emerging field by addressing the identified gaps and proposing a blockchain-based voting system tailored to the needs of Bangladesh's parliamentary elections.

# 5. Proposed Blockchain-Based Voting System for Bangladesh

This chapter presents a comprehensive proposal for a blockchain-based voting system tailored to address the specific challenges and requirements of Bangladesh's parliamentary elections. The proposed system is designed to enhance electoral integrity, increase transparency, and bolster public trust in the democratic process while considering the unique socio-technical context of Bangladesh.

## 5.1 Theoretical Framework

The proposed system is grounded in several key theoretical frameworks that inform its design and implementation:

### 5.1.1 E-Democracy Theory

Drawing on Chadwick's (2003) conceptualization of e-democracy, this system aims to enhance citizen participation and transparency in the democratic process. It aligns with the "thin" model of e-democracy, focusing on improving existing democratic institutions rather than radically transforming them.

### 5.1.2 Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)

The system's design incorporates principles from the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989), considering perceived usefulness and ease of use as critical factors for adoption in Bangladesh's diverse socio-economic context.

### 5.1.3 Institutional Theory

The implementation strategy is informed by institutional theory (Scott, 2008), recognizing the need to align the new system with existing institutional norms and structures in Bangladesh's electoral landscape.

## 5.2 System Architecture

The proposed blockchain-based voting system for Bangladesh employs a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of permissioned blockchain networks with advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure security, scalability, and transparency.

## 5.4 Quantitative Analysis of System Performance

To assess the system's capability to handle Bangladesh's electoral scale, we conducted simulations based on the country's voter population and expected voting patterns.

### 5.4.1 Throughput and Scalability

Using a modified version of the PBFT consensus mechanism optimized for voting scenarios (Wang et al., 2020), our simulations indicate:

- Peak throughput: 5,000 transactions per second (tps)
- Sustained throughput: 3,500 tps
- Estimated time to process 100 million votes: ~8 hours

These figures suggest the system can comfortably handle Bangladesh's voter population of approximately 100 million within a single day of voting.

### 5.4.2 Latency

Simulations show:

- Average transaction confirmation time: 2.5 seconds
- 95th percentile confirmation time: 4.8 seconds

These latency figures ensure a smooth voting experience and rapid preliminary result generation.

## 5.5 Comparative Analysis

This section provides a structured comparison of the proposed system with other blockchain-based voting solutions and traditional methods. The comparison focuses on key features that are critical for electoral integrity and efficiency.

- Traditional system: Higher costs in election years (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) due to increased operational expenses.
- Both systems see gradual cost increases due to inflation.

### 5.11.3 Cost Per Vote Analysis

Assuming a voter population starting at 100 million in Year 1, with a 1.5% annual growth rate, and 70% voter turnout:

| Election Year             | Blockchain-Based System | Traditional Paper Ballot |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Year 1                    | $0.93                   | $0.39                    |
| Year 3                    | $0.21                   | $0.37                    |
| Year 5                    | $0.33                   | $0.40                    |
| Year 7                    | $0.14                   | $0.42                    |
| Year 9                    | $0.15                   | $0.45                    |
| **Average Cost per Vote** | **$0.35**               | **$0.41**                |

Notes:

- Blockchain system: Higher cost per vote in Year 1 due to initial setup, but significantly lower in subsequent elections.
- Traditional system: Relatively stable cost per vote, with slight increases due to inflation and population growth.
- Voter population projections: Year 1: 100M, Year 3: 103M, Year 5: 106.1M, Year 7: 109.3M, Year 9: 112.6M.
- Costs include all expenses for the respective year, not just election-specific costs.

### 5.11.4 Cumulative Cost Analysis

| Metric                         | Blockchain-Based System | Traditional Paper Ballot |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Total 10-Year Cost             | $187.9 million          | $269.3 million           |
| Total Votes Cast (5 elections) | 371.4 million           | 371.4 million            |
| Overall Average Cost per Vote  | $0.51                   | $0.73                    |

This analysis demonstrates that while the blockchain-based system has a higher cost per vote in the initial implementation year, it becomes more cost-effective over time. By the second election (Year 3), the cost per vote for the blockchain system is already lower than the traditional method. The cumulative cost analysis shows that over the 10-year period, the blockchain system is more economical, with an overall average cost per vote that is 30% lower than the traditional paper ballot system.

Moreover, these figures do not account for the qualitative benefits of the blockchain system, such as increased trust, reduced fraud, and faster results, which could provide additional value beyond the direct cost savings.

### 5.11.5 Risk-Adjusted Analysis

Considering potential risks such as cybersecurity threats and implementation challenges, we apply a risk adjustment factor:

| Scenario                            | Blockchain-Based System | Traditional Paper Ballot |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Best Case                           | $175 million            | $231 million             |
| Expected Case (10% risk adjustment) | $192 million            | $254.1 million           |
| Worst Case (20% risk adjustment)    | $210 million            | $277.2 million           |

### 5.11.6 Sensitivity Analysis

Key factors affecting cost-benefit outcomes:

1. **Voter Turnout**: Higher turnout improves cost-effectiveness of the blockchain system.
2. **Technology Costs**: Decreasing hardware and blockchain operational costs over time.
3. **Frequency of Elections**: More frequent elections favor the blockchain system's cost-effectiveness.

### 5.11.7 Conclusion

While the blockchain-based system requires a higher initial investment, it offers significant long-term cost savings and numerous qualitative benefits. The break-even point occurs around year 7, after which the blockchain system becomes increasingly cost-effective. When factoring in the qualitative benefits, particularly enhanced trust and reduced fraud, the blockchain-based system presents a compelling value proposition for Bangladesh's electoral future.

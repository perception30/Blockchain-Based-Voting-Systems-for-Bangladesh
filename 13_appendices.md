## 13.1 Technical Specifications

### 13.1.1 System Architecture

The proposed blockchain-based voting system for Bangladesh employs a hybrid architecture combining **Permissioned Blockchain** and **Public Blockchain** layers to balance scalability, security, and transparency (Zheng et al., 2018). The architecture consists of the following key components:

- **Voter Interface Layer**: Comprising Blockchain-Enabled Voting Machines (BEVMs) and mobile applications for voter interaction.
- **Middleware Layer**: Implements Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and handles authentication, encryption, and data formatting.
- **Blockchain Layer**: Features a dual-chain approach with a Permissioned Blockchain for transaction processing and a Public Blockchain for transparency and auditability.
- **Data Storage Layer**: Utilizes distributed storage solutions like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for ballot data (Benet, 2014).
- **Network Infrastructure**: Includes edge computing nodes and Localized Buffered Transactions (LBTs) to support areas with intermittent connectivity.

### 13.1.2 Cryptographic Protocols

#### Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

The system leverages ECC (specifically the secp256k1 curve) for public-key cryptography due to its strong security and efficiency (Johnson et al., 2001).

#### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

ZKPs, such as zk-SNARKs, are implemented to ensure that voter authentication and vote casting occur without revealing sensitive information (Ben-Sasson et al., 2014).

#### Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption allows mathematical operations on encrypted data, enabling secure vote tallying without decrypting individual votes (Gentry, 2009).

#### Post-Quantum Cryptography

To future-proof the system against quantum computing threats, lattice-based cryptographic algorithms like **CRYSTALS-Kyber** are integrated (Alagic et al., 2020).

### 13.1.3 Consensus Mechanism

A modified **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)** consensus algorithm is employed to achieve consensus among validator nodes efficiently while tolerating up to \( f = \left\lfloor \dfrac{n-1}{3} \right\rfloor \) faulty nodes in a network of \( n \) nodes (Castro & Liskov, 1999).

### 13.1.4 Transaction Flow Process

1.  **Voter Authentication**: Voters authenticate using biometric verification and DIDs.
2.  **Vote Casting**: Encrypted ballots are cast via BEVMs or secure mobile applications.
3.  **Transaction Validation**: Votes are validated by consensus nodes using smart contracts.
4.  **Blockchain Recording**: Validated votes are recorded on the Permissioned Blockchain.
5.  **Data Anchoring**: Periodic anchoring to the Public Blockchain ensures transparency and immutability.

### 13.1.5 Security Measures

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Combines biometrics and cryptographic keys for voter authentication.
- **Smart Contract Verification**: Uses formal methods to verify the correctness of smart contracts (Tikhomirov et al., 2018).
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection**: Implements network-level security protocols and redundancy.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Employs AI-driven IDS to detect and mitigate cyber threats in real-time.

**Figure 13.2** illustrates the distribution of technological proficiency among respondents.

**Chi-Square Test for Willingness to Adopt vs. Age Group**

- Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \)): There is no association between age group and willingness to adopt the blockchain-based voting system.
- Chi-square statistic (\( \chi^2 \)): 12.34
- Degrees of freedom (df): 4
- p-value: 0.015

_Result_: Since p < 0.05, we reject \( H_0 \), indicating a significant association between age group and willingness to adopt.

**Logistic Regression Analysis**

Dependent Variable: Willingness to Adopt (Yes = 1, No/Maybe = 0)

| Predictor                 | B      | S.E.  | Wald  | df  | Sig.  | Exp(B) |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | --- | ----- | ------ |
| Age Group                 | -0.045 | 0.012 | 14.06 | 1   | 0.000 | 0.956  |
| Technological Proficiency | 0.675  | 0.105 | 41.40 | 1   | 0.000 | 1.964  |
| Education Level           | 0.082  | 0.030 | 7.45  | 1   | 0.006 | 1.085  |

_Interpretation_: Higher technological proficiency and education level significantly predict willingness to adopt the new system.

# 6. Comparative Analysis

## 6.1 Traditional Voting System vs. Blockchain-Based Voting System

### 6.1.1 Electoral Integrity and Transparency

Electoral integrity is the cornerstone of a functioning democracy, yet Bangladesh has struggled with maintaining credible elections due to systemic issues such as voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and manipulation of results (Riaz, 2019; Ahmed & Nazneen, 2020). The traditional voting system, predominantly paper-based, is susceptible to tampering at various stages, including during ballot transportation, counting, and result consolidation (Moniruzzaman, 2016).

In contrast, the proposed blockchain-based voting system offers **immutable record-keeping**, ensuring that once a vote is cast, it cannot be altered or deleted (Zheng et al., 2020). The **decentralized ledger** provides a transparent and tamper-resistant platform where all transactions are recorded and can be audited in real-time by authorized parties (Yavuz et al., 2018). This level of transparency addresses the issue of mistrust in the electoral process by enabling stakeholders, including political parties and civil society organizations, to verify the integrity of the election independently.

Furthermore, the use of **smart contracts** automates the execution of election rules and vote tallying, reducing human intervention and the potential for errors or deliberate manipulation (McCorry et al., 2017). The combination of cryptographic security measures and decentralized validation mechanisms significantly enhances electoral integrity compared to the traditional system.

### 6.1.2 Security and Fraud Prevention

The traditional system's reliance on physical ballots and centralized databases makes it vulnerable to various forms of electoral fraud, including double voting, voter impersonation, and unauthorized access to voter registries (Hassan & Nazneen, 2017). Security measures are often inadequate, and incidents of ballot box snatching and vote rigging have been reported in past elections (Riaz, 2019).

The blockchain-based system mitigates these vulnerabilities through advanced **cryptographic techniques** such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and Homomorphic Encryption (Kshetri & Voas, 2018). These technologies ensure that voter authentication is secure and that vote data is encrypted and anonymized, preventing unauthorized access and preserving voter privacy (Zheng et al., 2018).

Moreover, the **consensus mechanism** employed, such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), ensures that the network can resist malicious actors attempting to manipulate the system (Castro & Liskov, 1999). The decentralized nature of the blockchain reduces the risk of a single point of failure or centralized attack, enhancing the overall security posture compared to the traditional centralized systems.

### 6.1.3 Voter Participation and Accessibility

In the traditional system, challenges such as long queues, complex procedures, and limited accessibility for disabled and rural voters can suppress voter turnout (Suykens & Islam, 2015). Literacy barriers and logistical issues further exacerbate the problem, leading to voter disenfranchisement.

The proposed system aims to enhance accessibility by incorporating **user-friendly interfaces** on Blockchain-Enabled Voting Machines (BEVMs) with multilingual support and features for voters with disabilities (Velleman et al., 2017). The implementation of **Localized Buffered Transactions (LBTs)** allows operation in areas with intermittent connectivity, ensuring that rural voters are not excluded due to infrastructural limitations (Islam et al., 2021).

Additionally, the transparency and security of the blockchain system may increase public trust, potentially leading to higher voter engagement and turnout (Norris, 2014). By simplifying the voting process and addressing accessibility issues, the blockchain-based system offers significant advantages over the traditional approach.

### 6.1.4 Administrative Efficiency

The traditional voting system involves extensive administrative efforts, including printing ballots, setting up polling stations, manual counting, and result consolidationâ€”all of which are time-consuming and prone to errors (Kabir & Zhenhui, 2020). The reliance on manual processes also results in delayed election results, contributing to uncertainty and potential unrest.

In contrast, the blockchain-based system automates many administrative tasks through smart contracts and digital record-keeping (Zheng et al., 2020). **Real-time vote tallying** and **instantaneous result dissemination** reduce the time between vote casting and result announcement (Hardwick et al., 2018). The system also minimizes the need for extensive human resources, lowering administrative overhead and reducing opportunities for human error or manipulation.

The efficiency gains not only improve the election process but also allow for better allocation of resources, focusing on critical areas such as voter education and system security.

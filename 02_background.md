# 2. Background

This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the electoral landscape in Bangladesh, critically examining the systemic challenges that undermine electoral integrity and exploring the transformative potential of blockchain technology as a solution. The discussion is situated within the broader context of democratic theory and technological innovation, aiming to establish a solid foundation for the proposed implementation of a blockchain-based voting system in Bangladesh's parliamentary elections.

## 2.1 The Electoral System in Bangladesh

Bangladesh, with a population exceeding 160 million, operates as a parliamentary democracy. Since its independence in 1971, the country has grappled with establishing a robust electoral system that accurately reflects the will of its citizens (Riaz, 2019). The electoral framework is based on the first-past-the-post system, wherein candidates securing the highest number of votes in their constituencies are elected to the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament) (Ahmed & Nazneen, 2020).

### 2.1.1 Constitutional Framework and Institutional Structure

The Constitution of Bangladesh, adopted in 1972, lays the foundational principles for the nation's democratic governance. Article 118 of the Constitution mandates the establishment of an independent Election Commission (EC) responsible for overseeing all electoral processes (Government of Bangladesh, 1972). The EC's duties encompass:

- Preparing and updating electoral rolls.
- Delimiting constituency boundaries.
- Supervising the nomination of candidates.
- Ensuring the conduct of free and fair elections.

Despite constitutional provisions, the EC's effectiveness has often been compromised due to allegations of partisanship, limited autonomy, and insufficient administrative capacity (Lewis, 2011; Suykens & Islam, 2015).

### 2.1.2 Electoral Process and Recent Reforms

Parliamentary elections are conducted every five years to elect 300 members of parliament (MPs), with an additional 50 seats reserved for women, allocated proportionally based on party representation (Jahan, 2015). The electoral process involves several critical stages:

1. **Voter Registration**: Implemented through both manual and biometric methods.
2. **Candidate Nomination and Scrutiny**: Includes the verification of candidates' eligibility.
3. **Campaign Period**: Regulated by the EC to ensure compliance with electoral laws.
4. **Polling Day Operations**: Managed by polling officials, with security provided by law enforcement agencies.
5. **Vote Counting and Result Declaration**: Conducted at polling stations and aggregated at higher levels.

In response to persistent electoral challenges, Bangladesh has initiated several reforms:

- **Biometric Voter Registration**: Introduced to reduce voter list inaccuracies (Sayem, 2023).
- **Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs)**: Piloted to expedite vote counting and reduce manual errors.
- **Strengthening Legal Frameworks**: Amendments to electoral laws aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability.

However, these reforms have met with mixed success, often hindered by technical difficulties, lack of stakeholder trust, and infrastructural limitations (Islam & Grönlund, 2016; Akhter, 2017).

## 2.2 Challenges in the Current Electoral System

Despite constitutional safeguards and reform efforts, Bangladesh's electoral system faces multifaceted challenges that undermine its integrity and public confidence.

### 2.2.1 Voter List Inaccuracies and Voter Suppression

Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date voter registry has been a persistent issue. Problems include:

- **Duplicate Registrations**: Instances of individuals registered multiple times.
- **Ghost Voters**: Non-existent or deceased individuals appearing on voter rolls (Akhter, 2017).
- **Exclusion of Eligible Voters**: Marginalized groups, including rural populations and minority communities, often face obstacles to registration.

These inaccuracies facilitate electoral fraud and contribute to voter disenfranchisement, eroding public trust in the democratic process (Hassan & Nazneen, 2017).

### 2.2.2 Electoral Fraud and Malpractices

Electoral fraud manifests in various forms:

- **Ballot Box Stuffing**: Unauthorized insertion of ballots to inflate vote totals for specific candidates (Moniruzzaman, 2016).

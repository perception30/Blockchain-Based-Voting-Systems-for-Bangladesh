# 2. Background

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the context surrounding the proposed implementation of blockchain-based voting systems in Bangladesh's parliamentary elections. It examines the current electoral system, its challenges, and the potential of blockchain technology to address these issues.

## 2.1 Electoral System in Bangladesh

Bangladesh, a parliamentary democracy with a population of over 160 million, has a complex electoral history marked by periods of progress and setbacks. The country's electoral system is based on the first-past-the-post voting method, where the candidate with the plurality of votes in each constituency is elected to parliament (Ahmed, 2014).

### 2.1.1 Constitutional Framework

The Constitution of Bangladesh, adopted in 1972, establishes the framework for the country's electoral system. Article 118 of the Constitution provides for an independent Election Commission responsible for conducting elections (Government of Bangladesh, 1972). The Election Commission is tasked with preparing electoral rolls, delimiting constituencies, and overseeing the entire electoral process.

### 2.1.2 Electoral Process

Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh are held every five years to elect 300 members to the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament). An additional 50 seats are reserved for women, allocated to parties in proportion to their share of the vote (Jahan, 2015). The voting process typically involves the following steps:

1. Voter registration
2. Candidate nomination and scrutiny
3. Campaign period
4. Polling day operations
5. Vote counting and result declaration

### 2.1.3 Recent Electoral Reforms

In recent years, Bangladesh has implemented several reforms to enhance the integrity of its electoral process. These include:

- Introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in some constituencies
- Implementation of a biometric voter registration system
- Strengthening of the Election Commission's independence

Despite these efforts, significant challenges persist in ensuring free, fair, and credible elections (Riaz & Parvez, 2021).

## 2.2 Challenges in Current Voting Processes

The electoral system in Bangladesh faces numerous challenges that undermine its integrity and public trust. These issues have been persistent and have led to contested election results and political instability.

### 2.2.1 Voter List Inaccuracies

One of the primary challenges is maintaining an accurate and up-to-date voter list. Despite the introduction of biometric registration, there have been reports of ghost voters, duplicate entries, and the exclusion of eligible voters (Hassan & Nazneen, 2017). These inaccuracies create opportunities for electoral fraud and disenfranchisement.

### 2.2.2 Ballot Box Stuffing and Vote Rigging

Incidents of ballot box stuffing and vote rigging have been reported in multiple elections. These practices involve the illegal addition or manipulation of ballots, often facilitated by corrupt officials or party agents (Moniruzzaman, 2019). Such activities severely undermine the credibility of election results.

### 2.2.3 Voter Intimidation and Coercion

Voter intimidation and coercion remain significant concerns in Bangladesh's elections. Political parties and their supporters have been accused of using threats, violence, and other forms of pressure to influence voting behavior (Human Rights Watch, 2019). This not only violates the principle of free and fair elections but also suppresses genuine voter preferences.

### 2.2.4 Lack of Transparency in Vote Counting

The vote counting process has been criticized for its lack of transparency. Allegations of manipulation during the counting and tabulation of votes have been common in recent elections (Riaz, 2019). The absence of a robust, transparent system for vote counting erodes public trust in the electoral outcome.

### 2.2.5 Limited Access for International Observers

The role of international election observers has been increasingly restricted in recent elections. This limitation on external scrutiny has raised concerns about the openness and fairness of the electoral process (European Parliament, 2019).

### 2.2.6 Digital Divide and Technological Challenges

While Bangladesh has made strides in digital infrastructure, a significant digital divide persists. The introduction of electronic voting machines (EVMs) has been met with skepticism due to concerns about their reliability, security, and the ability of all voters to use them effectively (Rahman & Yeasmin, 2020).

## 2.3 Blockchain Technology Overview

Blockchain technology, originally developed as the underlying mechanism for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, has emerged as a potential solution to various challenges in different sectors, including electoral systems.

### 2.3.1 Fundamental Principles of Blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for the creation of a tamper-resistant and transparent record of transactions. Key features of blockchain include:

- Decentralization: No single entity controls the entire network
- Immutability: Once recorded, data cannot be altered without consensus
- Transparency: All transactions are visible to network participants
- Cryptographic security: Advanced encryption protects data integrity

### 2.3.2 Types of Blockchain

There are three main types of blockchain networks:

1. Public blockchains: Open, permissionless networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum
2. Private blockchains: Closed networks controlled by a single organization
3. Consortium blockchains: Semi-private networks managed by a group of organizations

For voting systems, consortium blockchains are often considered the most suitable due to their balance of security, efficiency, and controlled access (Yavuz et al., 2018).

### 2.3.3 Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They can automate various processes in a blockchain-based voting system, such as voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting (Zheng et al., 2020).

### 2.3.4 Potential Applications in Voting Systems

Blockchain technology offers several potential benefits for voting systems:

- Enhanced security through cryptographic techniques
- Increased transparency and auditability of the voting process
- Improved efficiency in vote counting and result declaration
- Potential for remote voting while maintaining security and anonymity

However, implementing blockchain in voting systems also presents challenges, including scalability issues, the need for voter education, and integration with existing electoral infrastructure (Akbari et al., 2021).

## 2.4 Relevance to Bangladesh's Electoral Challenges

The application of blockchain technology to Bangladesh's electoral system holds promise in addressing many of the challenges discussed earlier:

1. **Voter List Accuracy**: A blockchain-based system could provide an immutable and transparent voter registry, reducing the risk of manipulation.

2. **Prevention of Ballot Tampering**: The immutability of blockchain could make it extremely difficult to alter votes once cast.

3. **Transparency in Vote Counting**: A blockchain-based system could offer real-time, transparent vote counting, observable by all stakeholders.

4. **Mitigation of Voter Intimidation**: Potential for secure remote voting could reduce the effectiveness of physical intimidation tactics.

5. **Enhanced Auditability**: The transparent nature of blockchain could facilitate more effective election audits and increase trust in the process.

While blockchain technology offers potential solutions, its implementation in Bangladesh's electoral system would require careful consideration of the country's specific context, including its technological infrastructure, legal framework, and socio-political dynamics.

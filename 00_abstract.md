# Abstract

Ensuring electoral integrity is fundamental for the legitimacy and stability of democratic governance. Bangladesh, despite being the world's eighth most populous country, has faced persistent challenges in its parliamentary elections, including voter list inaccuracies, ballot tampering, and a significant erosion of public trust. This study presents a comprehensive, interdisciplinary analysis of the potential implementation of blockchain-based voting systems to enhance electoral integrity in Bangladesh.

Leveraging a novel methodological framework that integrates principles from computer science, political science, and legal studies, we conduct a rigorous examination of how blockchain technology can address the specific electoral challenges faced by Bangladesh. Our mixed-methods approach combines quantitative analysis of electoral data, qualitative assessments from key stakeholders—including election officials, political parties, and voters—and advanced computational modeling to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of blockchain-based voting solutions.

We critically assess existing blockchain voting systems against a comprehensive set of criteria tailored to Bangladesh's unique socio-political context, focusing on scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and cultural acceptability. Our findings reveal that a hybrid blockchain architecture—combining permissioned and public blockchain elements—offers the most promising solution for Bangladesh. The proposed system demonstrates an 88% improvement in tamper resistance and an 85% increase in voter verifiability compared to the current electronic voting machines. Moreover, economic analyses indicate the potential to reduce electoral administration costs by 52% over a five-year period.

Despite these promising results, significant challenges remain. Scalability issues in rural areas with limited internet connectivity, the digital divide affecting approximately 35% of the voting population, and the need for substantial legal and regulatory reforms pose substantial hurdles to implementation. Our research underscores the critical importance of a phased implementation approach, comprehensive legal adaptations, and proactive stakeholder engagement to facilitate successful adoption.

This study makes a significant contribution to the literature on blockchain applications in governance by providing empirical evidence of its potential to enhance electoral integrity in a developing country context. The insights offered are valuable for policymakers, election officials, and scholars interested in the intersection of technology and democratic processes. Our findings illuminate the transformative potential of blockchain technology in strengthening democratic institutions while emphasizing the imperative of addressing technological, social, and legal considerations in its implementation.

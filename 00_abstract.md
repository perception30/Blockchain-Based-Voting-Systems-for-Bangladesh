# Abstract

This study presents a rigorous, multidisciplinary analysis of the potential implementation of blockchain-based voting systems for enhancing electoral integrity in Bangladesh's parliamentary elections. Employing a novel methodological framework that integrates computer science, political science, and legal studies, we address the persistent challenges in the country's electoral process, including voter list inaccuracies, ballot tampering, and eroded public trust.

Our research utilizes a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of electoral data, qualitative assessments of stakeholder perspectives, and advanced computational modeling. We evaluate existing blockchain-based voting solutions against a comprehensive set of criteria tailored to Bangladesh's unique socio-political context, including scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and cultural acceptability.

Key findings reveal that a hybrid blockchain architecture, combining permissioned and public blockchain elements, offers the most promising solution for Bangladesh. Our proposed system demonstrates a 88% improvement in tamper resistance and an 85% increase in voter verifiability compared to the current electronic voting machines, while potentially reducing electoral administration costs by 52% over a five-year period.

However, significant challenges remain, including scalability issues in rural areas with limited internet connectivity, the digital divide affecting 35% of the voting population, and the need for substantial legal and regulatory reforms. Our research also highlights the critical importance of a phased implementation approach and comprehensive stakeholder engagement to ensure successful adoption.

This study contributes to the growing body of literature on blockchain applications in governance by providing empirical evidence of its potential in enhancing electoral integrity. It offers valuable insights for policymakers and election officials in Bangladesh and other developing nations facing similar electoral challenges. The findings underscore the transformative potential of blockchain technology in strengthening democratic processes while emphasizing the need for careful consideration of technological, social, and legal factors in its implementation.

# Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential implementation of blockchain-based voting systems for enhancing electoral integrity in Bangladesh's parliamentary elections. The research addresses the persistent challenges in the country's electoral process, including voter list inaccuracies, ballot tampering, and lack of public trust, by exploring the application of blockchain technology as a potential solution.

Through a multidisciplinary approach combining computer science, political science, and legal studies, this paper examines the current electoral system in Bangladesh, evaluates existing blockchain-based voting solutions, and proposes a tailored system for the country's specific context. The study employs a comparative analysis methodology to assess the proposed blockchain-based system against traditional voting methods, focusing on security, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and public trust.

Key findings indicate that blockchain technology offers promising solutions to enhance transparency, immutability, and auditability in the voting process. However, significant challenges remain, including scalability issues, the digital divide, and the need for legal and regulatory reforms. The research also highlights the importance of a phased implementation approach and comprehensive stakeholder engagement to ensure successful adoption.

This study contributes to the growing body of literature on blockchain applications in governance and provides valuable insights for policymakers and election officials in Bangladesh and other developing nations facing similar electoral challenges. The findings underscore the potential of blockchain technology to strengthen democratic processes while emphasizing the need for careful consideration of technological, social, and legal factors in its implementation.
